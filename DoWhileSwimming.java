// 2. Goofus and Gallant swim for the same amount of time.    

/* 3. For water temperature 78, Gallant swims for 0 minute
while Goffus swims for 1 minute.Thst is there is a 
variation in time between the two swimmers now as temperature decreases*/

// 4. Yes, Gallant check the water temperature bfore diving into it.

/* 5. A while loop test a condition to see if it true before executing
the statements in its block whiles a do-while loop executes statements 
in its block first before testing its condition.*/

// 5. The Pre-test loop is a While loop and the Post-test loop is a do-while loop.
